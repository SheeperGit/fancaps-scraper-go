## IMPORTANT NOTE
**DO NOT** USE THIS PROJECT (*YET*).

It is currently <ins>unfinished</ins>.

This README will be changed to reflect the state of the project in the future.

TODO (MENTION THIS TO WINDOWS USERS): WindowSizeMsg is used to report the terminal size. Note that **Windows** does not have support for reporting when resizes occur as it does not support the SIGWINCH signal. 

*Stay tuned~*
